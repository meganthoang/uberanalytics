## Action Items for 9/27/21:
- [ ] Find Data Sources and discuss project ideas
- [ ] Identify Project Interests (e.g. I personally would like to pursue a product-driven project)
- [ ] I think we should maybe in the meantime we could also find just analytics topics to explore, within python & using different modules. We could compile a list of different topics and each focus on a topic for the week, learn it, write a sample script demonstrating different functions, etc. and then share it with the group (kinda similar to how I've been trying to show you guys how to use github/git commands) -- this is just an idea tho
